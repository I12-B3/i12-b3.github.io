            <div>
                <p>
                    Yes, My Liege is an action game where the the player controls a Tax Collector who must collect
                    and deliver taxes from various buildings in order to pay the King's debt before time runs out.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Long ago lived an old king who had lived a life of partying, but now lay dying. When Death came
                    for him he proposed a deal in order to extend his life: he would pay Death in gold.
                    Death accepted the bargain and so the King continued living, his kingdom prospered,
                    people flocked to his side. Life seemed good.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After years the King had forgotten about the promise, but Death was not so absent minded.
                    Death appeared to the King and declared, "The time to pay is here, I will return in three
                    days and every seven days thereafter. One second too late and it'll be your last."
                </p>
                <p>
                    The King ran to the treasury, "Gold! Gold! How much gold do I have?" he cried. Upon learning
                    of the kingdom's lack of funds (due mainly to constant partying by none other than the King himself).
                    The King called upon his greatest asset in such times: The Tax Collector!
                </p>
                <p>
                    The game is all about collecting gold from the village before time runs out.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once collected gold can be donated to the peasants to upgrade their buildings or to the castle
                    for constructing new buildings or paying the debt. Bandits will try to steal the gold,
                    you can defend yourself but running away and using the guards is a better tactic. You need to
                    balance new and upgraded buildings with paying off the debt, all while avoiding bandits!

            <div>
                <p>
                    Save Sector J13 is a 2D top-down twin-stick shooter-style space sim where you shoot down pirates to
                    earn bounties in order to upgrade your ship. Your goal is to destroy the pirate leader,
                    recover important intel, and deliver it to the resistance headquarters planet.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As well as fighting pirates you can destroy asteroids to mine them for credits,
                    all the credits you earn can be spent at various planets on fuel, ammo, and upgrades for
                    your ship, as well as part-exchanging your ship for bigger and better ships.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ships are made up of 3 essential components:
                    The hull is the body of the ship, this determines what other components can be fitted into the ship,
                    as well as how much damage the ship can take before exploding.
                    The generator converts fuel into energy, bigger generators output more energy but have more mass.
                    The thrusters accelerate the ship, they control the maximum acceleration and velocity of the ship,
                    and energy consumption when accelerating. The ship's total mass affects acceleration/deceleration.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ships can also have up to 6 optional components:
                    Shields reduces damage from energy weapons, they consume energy while active but can be turned off.
                    Armour reduces damage from solid weapons, they don't use energy but have lots of mass.
                    Up to 4 weapon hard-points can be fitted with a variety of weapons such as: cannons, pulse lasers,
                    beam lasers & missile launchers. Some weapons use energy to fire while others use shells or missiles.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Every ship is fitted with a radar system that shows all objects in the current sector, the user's
                    ship is shown in blue and other contacts are shown in red, these could be asteroids, planets,
                    or other ships.

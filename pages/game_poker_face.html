            <div>
                <p>
                    Poker Face is a Texas Hold 'em style Poker game with randomly generated opponents. Players bet on matches consisting of three rounds each.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The flow of a round is as follows:<br>
                    Each player is dealt two cards which only they can see. There are also five community cards,
                    which all players can see. Players can raise the current bet, or fold taking themselves
                    out of the round. Once the fifth community card has been dealt any players who have not
                    folded reveal their cards and the player with the highest value hand takes the pot.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Players can create a custom character choosing their character's name and face.
                    There are several different face parts for eyes, nose, and mouth as well as hair and accessories.
                    Skin, hair, and eye colour as well as eye width, nose length and other details can be changed too.
